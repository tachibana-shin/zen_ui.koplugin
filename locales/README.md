# Zen UI Locales

This folder contains gettext `.po` files for Zen UI plugin labels.

The `en.po` file is the source catalog (~254 strings). All other locale files
are translated from it. Strings with an empty `msgstr ""` fall back to English
at runtime — KOReader handles this automatically.

## Contributing

pull request. Strings are grouped alphabetically by `msgid`. Leave `msgstr ""`
blank for any string you are not confident about — KOReader will fall back to
the English source string.
